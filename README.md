# YAMA: Yet Another Moxon Antenna

Welcome! This is my personal journey in crafting a budget-friendly, effective and protable antenna.

### The What
Before delving into the details, I realize not everyone who stumbles upon this page may be familiar with Moxon antennas - it's more common to find coding resources than antenna construction guides here. So, with the help of chatGPT, here's a simple explanation of a Moxon antenna:

>A Moxon antenna is a two-element directional antenna, primarily used for shortwave frequencies. It consists of a driven element and a slightly larger parasitic element, forming a rectangle with a small gap at the non-fed ends. This design offers several benefits: it has a compact size, provides good front-to-back ratio, and exhibits a directional radiation pattern. 

### The Why 
In the vast sea of internet resources, you'll find plenty of technical specifics and dimensions for building a proper Moxon antenna. However, converting those specifications into a physical entity is a different challenge. The key elements are the booms that support the antenna wire and the hub that aligns these booms in a 140-degree 'X' pattern. The existing designs online are varied, but none seemed to match the materials or tools I had on hand or could easily source. Therefore, I decided to contribute my own design approach to the online community, hoping it might aid others in their antenna-building endeavors.

### The How
### Parts List
1. 4x 3.6M telescopic fishing rods (the best I found were [GOTURE GOLDENLITE series](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C7CF2Y3W/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1&psc=1))
2. 4x 11" sections of 3/4 SCH40 PVC
3. 2x 12" sections of 1" SCH40 PVC
4. 1x 36" Section of 1" SCH40 PVC
5. 1x 1x3" Ubolt
Tethers:
6. 4x 10" section of Paracord
7. 4x #10 Eyelet crimp terminals with adheasive lined shrink tubing 
8. 4x 3mmx40mm dowels (I used golf tees)
9. 4x 2" section of 18awg magnet wire (for forming wire hooks)
Elements
10. 25'(approx) 26awg silicon wire (I really like [BNTECHGO 26 Gauge Silicone Wire](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072829WN7/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1) 
11. 4x #10 Eyelet crimp therminals
12. 2x 6" sections of Trimmer line
13. 2x #10 Eyelet crimp terminals with adheasive lined shrink tubing 

#### The supports (boom)
For the supports I went with the common appoach of using japanese fishing rods. I tried several but found the [GOTURE GOLDENLITE series](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C7CF2Y3W/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1&psc=1) to be the best. They are well constructed, thicker and stiffer than other poles of this type. I also like that their handles are ruberized with a metal ferrule which makes them eaisier to secure to the hub. Best of all they are cheap - I bought a two pack during black friday for $28 off Amazon. 
It is important to buy these longer than needed as the tip sections are really too thin to support the antenna wire. Removing the first 3 sections will get you down to the stiffer sections of the rod which reduces the overall length of the rod by 28-36". I went with a 12ft rod for my 10m moxon and a 18ft for the 20m version.

#### The Hub
##### Adapter 
The hub will be constructed out of common pvc. To secure the rod to the hub, I made an adapter out of 3/4" pvc pipe swaged at one end to lock into the ferrule on the handle of the fishing pole. 
The handle on the 18ft poles fit like a glove into SCH80 3/4" pipe. The thin wall of SCH80 also make it really easy to swage. Swaging was accomplished with a heat gun an a small cocktail jigger. PVC starts to melt between 212-500 degrees fahrenheit so even a hair dryer could probably work. Just heat a small section of end of the pipe until soft then force into the taper of the jigger and let cool.
